## 🧪 Testing & Development

### Testing with MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx keycloak-mcp-server
```
Visit `http://localhost:6274` to test all 80+ tools interactively.

### Local Development
```bash
npm run watch    # Auto-rebuild on changes
npm run dev     # Test server directly
```

### Stress Testing
The server has been stress-tested with 80+ consecutive operations without authentication failures, demonstrating production-level reliability.

## 🔧 Architecture

### Bulletproof Authentication System
- **Fresh Client Instances**: Creates new KcAdminClient for every request
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with 2 attempts maximum  
- **Connection Management**: 15-second timeout with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for all scenarios

### TypeScript Implementation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and logging
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns

## 📈 Production Ready

This package has been extensively tested and validated:
- ✅ **80+ consecutive operations** without authentication failures
- ✅ **Cross-realm operations** working seamlessly  
- ✅ **Parallel tool execution** supported
- ✅ **Complex search queries** with multiple filters
- ✅ **Error recovery** and detailed logging
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation** with zero errors
- ✅ **Complete Keycloak API coverage** with organization management

## 🎯 JWT Organization Problem Solved

This package specifically addresses the common JWT organization problem:
- ✅ **User Attributes**: Store organization data in user attributes
- ✅ **Protocol Mappers**: Create mappers to include organization in JWT tokens
- ✅ **Client Scopes**: Manage token scopes for organization claims
- ✅ **Organizations**: Full organization lifecycle management
- ✅ **Group Attributes**: Store organization metadata in groups

Example workflow:
1. Create organization using `create-organization`
2. Set user organization attribute using `set-user-attributes`
3. Create protocol mapper using `create-protocol-mapper` to include organization in JWT
4. Add user to organization using `add-organization-member`

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Use environment variables for credentials
- Enable HTTPS for production Keycloak instances
- Use strong admin passwords
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Monitor admin events and sessions
